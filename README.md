# 3DCube

**3DCube** is a lightweight 3D cube viewer built with Python and Pygame. It allows users to interactively rotate and scale a 3D cube in real-time. This application is designed for Linux systems.

## Features

- **Real-Time 3D Rendering**: Visualize a 3D cube with smooth rotation and scaling.
- **Interactive Controls**: Rotate the cube along the X, Y, and Z axes using keyboard inputs.
- **Mouse Wheel Scaling**: Zoom in and out to scale the cube dynamically.
- **Cross-Platform Codebase**: While designed for Linux, the code can be adapted for other platforms with minimal changes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YevheniiDimov/3DCube.git
   cd 3DCube
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python 3DCube.py
   ```

2. **Controls**:

   - **Rotate Cube**:
     - `A` / `D`: Rotate around the X-axis
     - `W` / `S`: Rotate around the Y-axis
     - `Z` / `X`: Rotate around the Z-axis

   - **Scale Cube**:
     - Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
